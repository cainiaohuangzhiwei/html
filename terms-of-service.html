      <h2>III. User-Generated Content</h2>

        <li>You are solely responsible for evaluating whether PhotoG and the images meet your needs, and you assume all risks associated with the use of the images you generate.</li>
        <li>You are fully responsible for any content you upload or submit to our website for processing or generation.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>IV. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>All intellectual property rights in our website and services, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, and patents, are owned by PhotoG. You may not use our intellectual property without our prior written consent.</li>

      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>V. Subscription and Refund</h2>
      <p>PhotoG offers a generous free version of the service for you to try before purchasing. Additionally, PhotoG allows you immediate access to and download of the content you generate. Therefore, when you make a purchase, you acknowledge the applicability of the service and waive your right to withdraw the purchase.</p>

      <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time under "Profile" &gt; "Manage Billing" in your account.</p>

      <p>You will receive an email reminder 7 days before your subscription is renewed. If you do not cancel your subscription before it is renewed, the subscription renewal fee will be charged. Subscription renewal fees are non-refundable.</p>

      <p>The refund policy is as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Refund within 7 days</strong><br>
        For orders within 7 days, if you have not generated any images, you can apply for a refund by contacting our customer service.</li>

        <li><strong>Refund after 7 days</strong><br>
        For orders more than 7 days old, you may apply for a refund by contacting our customer service for the following valid reasons (we will assess the reasonableness and authenticity of the application, so refunds are not guaranteed in such cases):
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Our software has been malfunctioning for an extended period (more than 7 consecutive days).</li>
            <li>Duplicate purchases due to payment platform issues.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Special cases not eligible for refunds</strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Orders purchased through unofficial channels.</li>
            <li>Customers who have entered into specific contracts, subject to the terms of the contract.</li>
            <li>Orders that do not meet the refund conditions.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cancellation of membership and currency</strong><br>
        After the refund is completed, the corresponding membership will be canceled, and the subscribed currency will be returned.</li>

        <li><strong>Refund processing time</strong><br>
        Under normal circumstances, we will process refunds within 3-7 working days. However, the actual refund time may vary depending on your payment method. Additionally, due to public holidays, the refund processing time may be longer than expected but generally will not exceed 20 days. If you have not received the refund within 20 days after your refund request is approved, please contact us to inquire about the refund status.</li>
      </ol>
